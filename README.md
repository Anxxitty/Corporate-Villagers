# Corporate Villagers

## Description
/!\ THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NO RELEASE IS PLANNED ANY TIME SOON /!\\
Adds Trader Villagers who will travel the world to Points of Interest where you will be able to sell them almost anything.
Prices will be fixed depending on the demand and on what you and other people on the server have to offer!
Try and be the richest man on your server, by building enormous factories and selling massively!
This mod is made to be compatible with big industrial mods like Create.


## Setup
Install the Fabric mod loader and download the last release of this mod (when it will release), put the mod in the `mods` folder, launch the game and enjoy!


## Compatibility for Forge and previous versions of Minecraft
I will first of all release this mod on Fabric in 1.19.x, and then try to make a 1.18.2 version.
I will port this mod to Forge if I have time, and if the mod becomes successful enough for me to receive a lot of requests.

## License
This mod is under the MIT license.
